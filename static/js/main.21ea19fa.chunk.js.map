Using psychological knowledge, marketers\n            can understand consumers’ behavior, their needs, desires, and\n            preferences. Such an awareness, can help them create an appropriate\n            product and distribute it effectively. Marketing psychology often\n            studies the motives of their consumers to identify what people want\n            to see on the market (Clare). Hence, they use different\n            psychological tactics to affect the customer to purchase a certain\n            product. For instance, it is always not difficult to remember\n            numbers shown in advertisements (Clare). It can be explained that\n            marketers use a special number pattern for easier remembering of\n            these numbers. Nevertheless, human psychology is far from being\n            fully studied and marketing psychology has much more to offer.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Intro;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nclass ProjectImgOne extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"project-img-one\">\n        <img src={require(\"../../Assets/slider1.jpg\")} alt=\"\" />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ProjectImgOne;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nconst ReadMore = props => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"readmore\">\n      <Link to={`/work${props.page}`}>\n        <span>Read More >> </span>\n      </Link>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ReadMore;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ReadMore from \"../ReadMore\";\n\nclass ProjectContent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    const props = this.props;\n    return (\n      <div className=\"project-content\">\n        <div className=\"pc-l\">{props.number}</div>\n        <div className=\"pc-r\">\n          <h2>{props.title}</h2>\n          {props.children}\n          <ReadMore page={props.page} />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ProjectContent;\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nclass ProjectImgTwo extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"project-img-two\">\n        <div className=\"pi-two\">\n          <img src={require(\"../../Assets/slider2.jpg\")} alt=\"\" />\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"pi-two\">\n          <img src={require(\"../../Assets/slider3.jpg\")} alt=\"\" />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ProjectImgTwo;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ProjectTitle from \"../Component/ProjectTitle\";\nimport Intro from \"../Component/Intro\";\nimport ProjectImgOne from \"../Component/ProjectImgOne\";\nimport ProjectContent from \"../Component/ProjectContent\";\nimport ProjectImgTwo from \"../Component/ProjectImgTwo\";\n\nclass Work extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <ProjectTitle>Psychological tactics in marketing</ProjectTitle>\n        <Intro />\n        <ProjectImgOne />\n        <ProjectContent\n          number=\"#01\"\n          title=\"Psychological tactics.

It is also considered to\n            encourage appetite, which is typical for fact food advertisement\n            (Ciotti). Coca-Cola and Skittles attract their customer by bright\n            red colors of their logos. The green color is easily perceived by\n            people and used when promoting various organic and health sales. For\n            instance, the majority of pharmacies in their logos, use green color\n            that refers to health. Everybody wants to remain healthy, and,\n            obviously, in case of the disease go to such an institution.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The orange color is widely used by numerous advertising campaigns.\n            It is associated with warmth and sun, fun (Ciotti). It is also\n            believed that people consider this color to be “cheap.” This color\n            is often used in products targeting kids. Orange especially catches\n            their attention. For example, kids like Fanta due to the orange\n            splashes shown in the advertising campaign (Ciotti). Blues color is\n            associated with water, peace, and loyalty. It tends to provide a\n            sense of security and promotes trust in the brand. It also\n            stimulates productivity and, as a result, is used mainly for offices\n            and conservative corporate brands (Ciotti). A number of IT\n            corporations such as Facebook, Twitter, Skype, Siemens, and Samsung\n            use this color for the promotion of their products and services. In\n            this case, blue refers to a feeling of reliability.\n          </p>\n          <ProjectImgOne />\n          <p>\n            The purple color refers to royalty, wisdom, creativity, and magic.\n            It stands between the color psychologies of red and blue colors.\n            Hence, while red is associated with energy and intensity, blue\n            brings feelings of stability and relaxation. According to color\n            psychology, purple color has calming effects and can encourage\n            creativity. Usually, brands that see their position as prestigious\n            use such a color (Ciotti). The black color is widely used by\n            marketing campaigns since it refers to power and luxury. Hence,\n            numerous prosperous brands use this color. For example, such brands\n            as Chanel, Apple, Nike, LG, Ander Armor apply the psychology of this\n            color to make their customer be sure of their stable position on the\n            market.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"work-page-changepage\">\n          <Link to=\"/work02\">\n            <span style={{ textDecoration: \"underline\" }}>Next>></span>\n          </Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Work01;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport ProjectTitle from \"../Component/ProjectTitle\";\nimport ProjectImgTwo from \"../Component/ProjectImgTwo\";\nimport ProjectImgOne from \"../Component/ProjectImgOne\";\nimport { Link } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nclass Work02 extends React.Component {\n  componentDidMount = () => {\n    console.log(window.pageYOffset);\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0);\n  };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"work-pages\">\n        <ProjectTitle>Psychological Tactic.

It is believed to be energetic and focused. Moreover, it\n            tends to depict dynamics, action, strength, balance, and direction\n            (Pahwa). When placed on its base, they depict stability, thus in\n            case they are tilted, instability and tension are depicted.\n          </p>\n          <ProjectImgOne />\n          <p>\n            One more figure used in marketing psychology is a circle.

They depict love, movement, eternity, protection, and\n            mysteriousness are depicted by the circles. For example Google\n            Chrome is a circle that includes a wide variety of services and\n            valuable access to world wide web. Besides, despite the fact that\n            these shapes are less common, they attract the attention of the\n            customer more effectively. Another shape is curve that is associated\n            with happiness. They remain creative and generous (Pahwa).

Hence, various\n            rewards and incentives are used to make customers take an action\n            (Leary). Many companies offer free products, guides, and other\n            freebies to establish contact with their target audience. For\n            example, very often consumers can get free spoons with cereals or\n            tea or one extra bottle of beer in addition to the whole pack\n            (Leary). Usually, customers do not understand that the price of this\n            free product is already included in the main one. Moreover, usually,\n            free products are of lower quality that the main one. Marketers\n            understand people’s nature of greediness and use this for promoting\n            their business.\n          </p>\n          <ProjectImgOne />\n          <p>\n            Gamification remains a psychological tactic that considers game\n            application into content to engage one’s target audience. It can be\n            widely used in different applications, quizzes, advertisements, and\n            socials media sites. Gamification is believed to increase brand\n            awareness, collect insights, and attract consumers (Hussain). It\n            concerns implementation of various elements of the game such as\n            challenges, milestones and rewards to communicate with consumers\n            more effectively. For instance, McDonald’s uses gamification for the\n            promotion of its brand. It gives the customer an opportunity to win\n            different goods for free and, as a result, they remain more\n            interested in the company. Gamification also creates a sense of\n            achievement and evokes peoples’ competitive nature to encourage them\n            to use a targeted website or application.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"work-page-changepage2\">\n          <Link to=\"/work03\">\n            <span style={{ textDecoration: \"underline\" }}>{\"<<\"}Prev</span>\n          </Link>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Work04;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { HashRouter, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Layout from \"./Component/Layout\";\nimport \"./App.scss\";\nimport Header from \"./Component/Header\";\nimport Home from \"./Pages/Home\";\nimport Footer from \"./Component/Footer\";\nimport Loading from \"./Component/Loading\";\nimport Work from \"./Pages/Work\";\nimport Work01 from \"./Pages/Work01\";\nimport Work02 from \"./Pages/Work02\";\nimport Work03 from \"./Pages/Work03\";\nimport Work04 from \"./Pages/Work04\";\n\nconst Page404 = () => {\n  return <div>Page404</div>;\n};\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  state = {\n    isLoading: true\n  };\n  componentDidMount = () => {\n    window.addEventListener(\"load\", () =>\n      this.setState({\n        isLoading: false\n      })\n    );\n  };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <HashRouter>\n        <Layout>\n          <Header />\n          {this.state.isLoading && <Loading />}\n          <Switch>\n            <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\n            <Route exact path=\"/work\" component={Work} />\n            <Route exact path=\"/work01\" component={Work01} />\n            <Route exact path=\"/work02\" component={Work02} />\n            <Route exact path=\"/work03\" component={Work03} />\n            <Route exact path=\"/work04\" component={Work04} />\n            <Route component={Page404} />\n          </Switch>\n          <Footer />\n        </Layout>\n      </HashRouter>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
