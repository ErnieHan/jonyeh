          I am an international business major and accounting minor student, I
          have interacted with various pieces of information that relate to
          finance, customers, communication and business. The knowledge I have
          gained from this academic milieu has even assured me of my ability to
          excel in any business endeavor. As a young person, I used to accompany
          my parents to banks and other business places such as malls. During
          these times, I envied the way people here operated their business and
          the manner in which bank employees organized themselves. In fact, the
          bank setup was quite admirable.
