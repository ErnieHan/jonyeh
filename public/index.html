    <meta name="description" content="I am an international business major and accounting minor student, I have interacted with various pieces of information that relate to finance, customers, communication and business. The knowledge I have gained from this academic milieu has even assured me of my ability to excel in any business endeavor. As a young person, I used to accompany my parents to banks and other business places such as malls. During these times, I envied the way people here operated their business and the manner in which bank employees organized themselves. In fact, the bank setup was quite admirable." />
